Tasks for conditions
1) Is the number divisible by 5, or by 3, or by 2 without a remainder?

Tasks for cycles (Only FOR)

1) Print the factorial of the requested number. (5!=1*2*3*4*5)
2) *calculate the sum of the first N elements of the sequence 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + ...+ 1/N . parameter N is set by the user
3) Find the product of integers from lim1 to lim2 (for example, if lim1=5 and lim2=12 then this is the product of all numbers from 5 to 12).

Tasks for functions
0) Create an isAdult function that will check the user's age for adulthood.
Expected output:
isAdult(20); // true
isAdult(4); // false
1) * A function that asks for a number and checks whether it is prime (a prime number can be divided without a remainder by itself and by one)
2) Create a checkMultiplicity function that takes two numbers and checks if the first is divisible by the second:

checkMultiplicity(25, 5) // true
checkMultiplicity(15, 3) // true
checkMultiplicity(15, 5) // true
checkMultiplicity(15, 4) // false

3) Checking the possibility of a triangle. Create a function that takes the length of a triangle; the function returns true if the triangle is possible and false otherwise
4) Write functions for calculating areas (surfaces) of the following figures/bodies: triangle, rectangle (cone, parallelepiped)

Tasks for objects
1. create a Student object that contains the following properties: first name, last name, gender, contact information, methods: address output, gender change.
2. create an object that contains properties about the faculty and department, methods: transfer to another faculty. (you can choose)
